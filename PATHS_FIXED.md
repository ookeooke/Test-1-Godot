# ✅ Path References - ALL FIXED!

## The Problem You Found

When you ran the game, you saw this error:
```
Invalid access to property or key 'gold_changed' on a base object of type 'Node'.
```

This happened because some scene files still had OLD paths to scripts that were moved.

---

## What I Fixed

### ✅ Fixed Files (6 total):

1. **scenes/managers/game_manager.tscn**
   - OLD: `res://game_manager.gd`
   - NEW: `res://scripts/autoloads/game_manager.gd`

2. **scenes/ui/build_menu.tscn**
   - OLD: `res://build_menu.gd`
   - NEW: `res://scripts/ui/build_menu.gd`

3. **scenes/ui/tower_info_menu.tscn**
   - OLD: `res://tower_info_menu.gd`
   - NEW: `res://scripts/ui/tower_info_menu.gd`

4. **scenes/enemies/goblin_scout.tscn**
   - OLD: `res://goblin_scout.gd`
   - NEW: `res://scenes/enemies/goblin_scout.gd`

5. **scenes/enemies/orc_warrior.tscn**
   - OLD: `res://orc_warrior.gd`
   - NEW: `res://scenes/enemies/orc_warrior.gd`

6. **scenes/spots/hero_spot.tscn**
   - OLD: `res://hero_spot.gd`
   - NEW: `res://scenes/spots/hero_spot.gd`

7. **scenes/spots/tower_spot.tscn**
   - OLD: `res://tower_spot.gd`
   - NEW: `res://scenes/spots/tower_spot.gd`

## ✅ Now Everything Should Work!

### What to Do Now:

1. **In Godot, click "Reload Project"**
   - Project → Reload Current Project
   - OR close Godot and reopen

2. **Press F5 to test**
   - Game should start without errors
   - Console should show clean startup

3. **Verify**
   - No red errors
   - Camera works
   - Can place towers
   - Enemies spawn

---

## Why This Happened

When I moved files with the script, the `.tscn` scene files still had hardcoded paths to the OLD locations. Godot didn't automatically update these internal references.

Now all 7 scene files have been updated to point to the correct new paths!

---

## Test It Now!

**In Godot:**
1. Project → Reload Current Project
2. Press F5
3. Should work perfectly! ✅

Let me know if you still see any errors!
