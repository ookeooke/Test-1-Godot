## üí° Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Plan First, Build Later**
Don't create wave files until you've planned all compositions in [LEVEL_PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md](LEVEL_PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md). Makes everything faster!

### **Tip 2: Copy & Modify**
Always copy an existing level folder and modify it. Faster than creating from scratch.

### **Tip 3: Test Often**
Test each level immediately after creating it. Easier to fix issues early.

### **Tip 4: Batch Similar Levels**
Create levels 3-5 in one session, then 6-8 in another. Builds momentum.

### **Tip 5: Balance Last**
Get all 30 levels created first, then do a balancing pass. Easier to see the full difficulty curve.

## üêõ Common Issues

### "Can't find wave files"

**Fix:** Check console for errors. Usually means level config isn't in campaign.

### "Wrong number of enemies"
**Fix:** Edit the wave file in Inspector. Change the `count` value.
