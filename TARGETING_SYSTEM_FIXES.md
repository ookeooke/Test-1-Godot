# Targeting System Fixes - Complete

## Overview
This document describes the industry-standard targeting fixes applied to both towers and heroes in your tower defense game, bringing the system to Kingdom Rush / Bloons TD quality.

## ✅ TOWER TARGETING FIXES (Phase 1 - CRITICAL)

### **Fix 1: Enemy Death Signal Listener**
**File:** [scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd](scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd:129-131)

**Problem:** Towers didn't know when enemies died, continuing to track dead enemies.

**Solution:** Connect to `enemy_died` signal when enemy enters range.

```gdscript
func _on_enemy_entered_range(body):
    if body.is_in_group("enemy"):
        enemies_in_range.append(body)

        # Connect to enemy death signal for immediate cleanup
        if body.has_signal("enemy_died") and not body.enemy_died.is_connected(_on_enemy_died):
            body.enemy_died.connect(_on_enemy_died.bind(body))
```

**Impact:**
- Towers instantly know when enemies die
- No more shooting at corpses
- Clean enemy list maintenance

---

### **Fix 2: Instant Retargeting on Death**
**File:** [scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd](scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd:139-152)

**Problem:** 0.833 second delay after current target dies before finding new target.

**Solution:** Immediately retarget when current target dies.

```gdscript
func _on_enemy_died(enemy):
    """Called when an enemy dies - remove immediately and retarget"""
    # Remove from tracking list
    enemies_in_range.erase(enemy)

    # If this was our current target, immediately find new target
    if current_target == enemy:
        print("⚠ Current target died! Retargeting immediately...")
        current_target = get_furthest_enemy()

        # If we found a new target and we're ready to shoot, shoot immediately
        if current_target != null and shoot_timer.time_left < 0.1:
            shoot_at(current_target)
```

**Impact:**
- Zero DPS downtime during waves
- Towers maintain high attack uptime
- Smooth, continuous firing behavior

**Before:** Tower → shoots → enemy dies → waits 0.833s → finds new target
**After:** Tower → shoots → enemy dies → immediately retargets and shoots

---

### **Fix 3: Validate Target Before Shooting**
**File:** [scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd](scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd:219-223)

**Problem:** Tower could create arrows for dead/invalid targets.

**Solution:** Check `is_instance_valid()` before shooting.

```gdscript
func shoot_at(target):
    # Validate target is alive
    if not is_instance_valid(target):
        print("⚠ Target is dead/invalid, aborting shot")
        current_target = null
        return
```

**Impact:**
- Never create projectiles for dead enemies
- Cleaner projectile lifecycle
- Better error handling

---

### **Fix 4: Remove Out-of-Range Targets**
**File:** [scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd](scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd:225-232)

**Problem:** Out-of-range targets stayed in list, tower kept trying to shoot them.

**Solution:** Remove from `enemies_in_range` when range check fails.

```gdscript
func shoot_at(target):
    var distance_to_target = global_position.distance_to(target.global_position)
    if distance_to_target > range_radius:
        print("⚠ Target out of range, skipping shot")
        # Remove from enemies_in_range since it's unreachable
        enemies_in_range.erase(target)
        current_target = null
        return
```

**Impact:**
- Clean enemy list
- No wasted targeting attempts
- Better edge case handling

---

### **Fix 5: Secondary Sorting (Distance Tiebreaker)**
**File:** [scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd](scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd:177-185)

**Problem:** Random behavior when two enemies at same path progress.

**Solution:** Use distance as tiebreaker for consistent targeting.

```gdscript
# Primary sort: furthest along path
if progress > furthest_progress:
    furthest = enemy
    furthest_progress = progress
    furthest_distance = distance
# Secondary sort: if tied on progress, pick closer enemy (tiebreaker)
elif progress == furthest_progress and distance < furthest_distance:
    furthest = enemy
    furthest_distance = distance
```

**Impact:**
- Consistent, predictable targeting
- No random switching between tied enemies
- Industry best practice

---

## ✅ HERO TARGETING FIXES (Phase 2)

### **Fix 6: Debug Output for Hero Attacks**
**File:** [scenes/heroes/ranger_hero.gd](scenes/heroes/ranger_hero.gd:324-343)

**Problem:** Heroes not attacking, no error messages to debug.

**Solution:** Add clear debug prints to identify issues.

```gdscript
func shoot_arrow():
    # Debug: Check if arrow scene is assigned
    if arrow_scene == null:
        print("⚠️ Hero CANNOT SHOOT: arrow_scene is null! Check Inspector settings.")
        return

    current_ranged_target = get_closest_ranged_enemy()
    if current_ranged_target == null or not is_instance_valid(current_ranged_target):
        print("⚠️ Hero: No valid ranged target found")
        return

    print("🏹 Hero shooting arrow at: ", current_ranged_target.get_enemy_name())
```

**Impact:**
- **Immediately shows root cause if heroes not attacking**
- Clear error message if `arrow_scene` not assigned in Inspector
- Helps debug detection/targeting issues

**To Fix Hero Not Attacking:**
1. Launch game
2. Watch console for: `⚠️ Hero CANNOT SHOOT: arrow_scene is null!`
3. If you see this → Open `ranger_hero.tscn` in Inspector
4. Assign `arrow_scene` to `res://scenes/projectiles/arrow.tscn`

---

### **Fix 7: Hero Target Persistence**
**File:** [scenes/heroes/ranger_hero.gd](scenes/heroes/ranger_hero.gd:290-295)

**Problem:** Heroes retargeted every frame, causing jittery behavior.

**Solution:** Keep current target until it dies or leaves range.

```gdscript
func get_closest_ranged_enemy():
    if enemies_in_ranged_range.is_empty():
        return null

    # TARGET PERSISTENCE: If current target still valid and in range, keep it
    if current_ranged_target and is_instance_valid(current_ranged_target):
        if enemies_in_ranged_range.has(current_ranged_target):
            # Don't keep melee-range enemies as ranged targets
            if not enemies_in_melee_range.has(current_ranged_target):
                return current_ranged_target

    # Need new target - find closest
    [...]
```

**Impact:**
- Smooth, predictable hero behavior
- No target thrashing
- Matches tower persistence pattern
- Better visual clarity for players

## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER COMPARISON

### **Tower Behavior**

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Enemy dies** | Keeps targeting corpse for 0.833s | Instantly retargets |
| **Out of range** | Keeps trying to shoot | Removes from list |
| **Dead target shot** | Creates arrow for dead enemy | Validates before shooting |
| **Tied progress** | Random selection | Consistent (closer enemy) |

### **Hero Behavior**

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Multiple enemies** | Switches target every frame | Sticks to current target |
| **Not attacking** | Silent failure | Clear error message |
| **Target dies** | Picks new target immediately | Picks new target immediately |

---

## 🎯 TESTING CHECKLIST

### **Tower Tests:**
1. ✅ Launch game, place archer tower
2. ✅ Spawn wave, verify tower shoots
3. ✅ Kill enemy mid-attack → tower should immediately retarget
4. ✅ No arrows flying to empty space
5. ✅ Check console for "⚠ Current target died! Retargeting immediately..."

### **Hero Tests:**
1. ✅ Launch game, place hero
2. ✅ Check console on game start:
   - If you see `⚠️ Hero CANNOT SHOOT: arrow_scene is null!` → Fix in Inspector
   - If no error → hero should attack when enemies in range
3. ✅ Multiple enemies → hero should stick to one target, not switch rapidly
4. ✅ Check console for "🏹 Hero shooting arrow at: [enemy name]"

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Heroes Still Not Attacking**

**Checklist:**
1. **Arrow Scene Not Assigned**
   - Open `scenes/heroes/ranger_hero.tscn` in Godot
   - Select root node (RangerHero)
   - In Inspector, find `Arrow Scene` property
   - Assign: `res://scenes/projectiles/arrow.tscn`

2. **Timers Not Starting**
   - Console should show: "✓ Ranger Hero ready at: [position]"
   - If timer issues, check `enter_ranged_combat()` is called

3. **Detection Not Working**
   - Verify enemies on collision layer 1
   - Verify hero detection areas mask layer 1
   - Check enemy path runs through hero detection range

4. **Arrow Scene Issues**
   - Verify `arrow.tscn` exists and has `arrow.gd` script
   - Check arrow has `setup(target, damage)` method
