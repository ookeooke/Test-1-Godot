# Tower Targeting Fix - Target Persistence Balance

## 🎯 The Problem (Simple Explanation)

**Before Fix:** Tower locks onto first enemy it sees and NEVER switches to better targets.

**Example:**
```
[Spawn] → [Enemy A: 50%] → [Enemy B: 70%] → [Your Base: 100%]
          ↑ Tower stuck here forever!
```

Even though Enemy B is **20% closer to your base**, the tower keeps shooting Enemy A.

---

## ✅ The Solution

**After Fix:** Tower keeps its target for smooth aiming, BUT switches to **significantly better targets** (5%+ further on path).

**Example:**
```
[Spawn] → [Enemy A: 50%] → [Enemy B: 70%] → [Your Base: 100%]
                            ↑ Tower switches to Enemy B! (20% gap)
```

Tower now switches to Enemy B because it's more than 5% further along the path.

## 🔧 What Changed

### **File:** `scenes/towers/archer_tower.gd` (Lines 162-182)

**Old Code (Lines 162-166):**
```gdscript
if current_target and is_instance_valid(current_target):
    if enemies_in_range.has(current_target):
        return current_target  # ❌ STOPS HERE - TOO PERSISTENT
```

**New Code (Lines 162-182):**
```gdscript
if current_target and is_instance_valid(current_target):
    if enemies_in_range.has(current_target):
        # Get current target's progress
        var current_progress = _get_enemy_progress(current_target)
        var should_switch = false

        # Check if any enemy is 5%+ further along the path
        for enemy in enemies_in_range:
            var enemy_progress = _get_enemy_progress(enemy)
            if enemy_progress > current_progress + 0.05:  # 5% threshold
                should_switch = true
                print("  ⚡ Better target found! Current: %.1f%%, New: %.1f%%" % [current_progress * 100, enemy_progress * 100])
                break

        if not should_switch:
            # No significantly better target - keep current
            return current_target
        # Otherwise find the furthest enemy
```

## 📊 How It Works (Visual Examples)

### **Example 1: No Switch (Small Difference)**

```
Enemy A: 50% progress (current target)
Enemy B: 53% progress (new enemy)
Difference: 3% → LESS than 5% threshold
Result: ✅ Keep shooting Enemy A (smooth aiming)
```

### **Example 2: Switch (Large Difference)**

```
Enemy A: 50% progress (current target)
Enemy B: 70% progress (new enemy)
Difference: 20% → MORE than 5% threshold
Result: ⚡ Switch to Enemy B (better target!)
```

### **Example 3: Keep Better Target**

```
Enemy A: 80% progress (current target - very close to base)
Enemy B: 75% progress (new enemy - further back)
Difference: -5% → Enemy A is still better
Result: ✅ Keep shooting Enemy A (already optimal)
```

## 🎮 Testing Instructions

### **Test 1: Basic Switching**
1. Place archer tower
2. Spawn Enemy A → tower locks onto it
3. Spawn Enemy B that walks faster or spawns later
4. When Enemy B gets 5%+ ahead → watch console for:
   ```
   ⚡ Better target found! Current: 45.0%, New: 65.0%
   Tower switched target to: [Enemy B name]
   ```

### **Test 2: No Unnecessary Switching**
1. Place tower
2. Spawn 3 enemies close together (similar progress)
3. Tower should stick to one target (smooth aiming)
4. No rapid switching between similar enemies

### **Test 3: Priority System**
1. Place tower near end of path
2. Spawn slow enemy A
3. Wait 5 seconds
4. Spawn fast enemy B
5. When Enemy B overtakes Enemy A → tower switches to B

## 📈 Expected Behavior

| Scenario | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Enemy at 50%, new enemy at 53% | ❌ Keep 50% | ✅ Keep 50% (smooth) |
| Enemy at 50%, new enemy at 70% | ❌ Keep 50% | ✅ Switch to 70% |
| Enemy at 80%, new enemy at 75% | ❌ Keep 80% | ✅ Keep 80% (better) |
| Enemy at 90%, dies mid-shot | ❌ Wait 0.8s | ✅ Instant retarget |

---

## 🎯 Why 5% Threshold?

### **Balance Between Two Goals:**

1. **Smooth Aiming** (low threshold)
   - Don't switch for tiny differences
   - Weapon rotates smoothly
   - Professional appearance

2. **Optimal Targeting** (high threshold)
   - Switch to threats closer to base
   - Prevent enemies from leaking through
   - Kingdom Rush strategy

### **5% is the Sweet Spot:**

| Threshold | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| 1% | ❌ Too jittery - switches constantly |
| 5% | ✅ Perfect - smooth + responsive |
| 20% | ❌ Too slow - enemies slip through |

## 🏆 Kingdom Rush Comparison

### **Your Game Now Matches Kingdom Rush:**

| Feature | Your Game | Kingdom Rush | Match? |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Primary Sort** | Furthest on path | Furthest on path | ✅ |
| **Target Persistence** | Yes (balanced) | Yes | ✅ |
| **Switch to Better Targets** | Yes (5% threshold) | Yes (implicit) | ✅ |
| **Instant Retarget on Death** | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| **Smooth Aiming** | Yes | Yes | ✅ |

## 🔍 Debug Output

When testing, watch the console for these messages:

```
Tower acquired target: Goblin Scout
  ⚡ Better target found! Current: 45.0%, New: 68.0%
Tower switched target to: Orc Warrior
⚠ Current target died! Retargeting immediately...
Tower acquired target: Wolf Runner
```

---

## ✅ Summary

**Problem Fixed:** Towers now properly prioritize enemies closest to your base while maintaining smooth targeting behavior.

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Towers check for significantly better targets (5%+ threshold)
- ✅ Balanced persistence (smooth aiming + optimal strategy)
- ✅ Instant retargeting on death (already implemented)
- ✅ Matches Kingdom Rush quality targeting

**Test Result:** Tower targeting should now feel responsive and intelligent, switching to threats that need attention while maintaining smooth weapon rotation.
