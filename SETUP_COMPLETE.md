## Files Added

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Want to Add Camera Settings Menu?

I can create a settings UI scene where players can:
- Toggle edge scroll on/off
- Toggle camera shake on/off
- Toggle inertia on/off
- Adjust camera speeds (0.5x to 2.0x)

Just ask: "Create camera settings UI scene"

### Want to Customize Camera Settings?

Open `node_2d.tscn` in Godot and select the Camera2D node.
In the Inspector, you can adjust:
- **Min Zoom** (default: 0.3 for PC, 0.4 for mobile)
- **Max Zoom** (default: 1.5 for PC, 1.3 for mobile)
- **Default Zoom** (default: 0.6)
- **Level Rect** (your playable area bounds)
- **Edge Scroll Speed**
- **Keyboard Pan Speed**
- And many more...

### Want to Add More Camera Effects?

Use `CameraEffects` anywhere in your code:

```gdscript
# Different shake intensities
CameraEffects.small_shake(camera)      # Subtle
CameraEffects.medium_shake(camera)     # Normal
CameraEffects.large_shake(camera)      # Big impact
CameraEffects.massive_shake(camera)    # Huge explosion

# Focus camera on objects
CameraEffects.focus_on_tower(camera, tower)
CameraEffects.focus_on_hero(camera, hero)
CameraEffects.overview_zoom(camera)

# Dramatic sequences
CameraEffects.boss_intro_sequence(camera, boss)
CameraEffects.victory_sequence(camera)
CameraEffects.defeat_sequence(camera, base_position)
```
